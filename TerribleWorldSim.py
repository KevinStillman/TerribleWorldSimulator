# background:
#   Create a program that 'emulates' the world, but in numerical values for everything. (At least in the back end)
#   Have a simple GUI where it's something like a graph or some sort of display to show data, and below that
#   display area, there can be buttons for things like Start, Stop, Reset, Quit, etc. The data shown in the 'display'
#   will contain things like "# of people alive" "day/month/year", "% of good/bad people", and more

# Timelines: the sim will move at a rate of 1s = 30 days. It will probably work in a loop that looks loosely like this


# while gameOver is False:
#   *code for whatever happens in a month*
#   time.sleep(1)
#   *code to add that last seconds/months data, aswell as update variables to keep displayed time correct



# Thoughts ~~
# People can be 'classified' as good and bad. If they're a good person, the number that represents them will be
# a positive number, if they're a bad person, a negative number. This will be chosen on 'spawn' at random.
# There can be a chance for people to spawn as 100% good or 100% bad too, which will have effects on their life
# that can be figured out later.

# There can be a random chance for a natural disaster where sims could die/stuff like that?
