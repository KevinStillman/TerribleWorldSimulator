Talk between Kevin and Mortiz on disc about population/spawning/Chunks



################################################################################################################
############################## POPULATION AND SPAWN/DEATH
example - Germany:


1000 people > on average 9 of them have a child in 1 year.

Basic function to calculate natural birth rates ?

Value based on region ties into that rate

---------------------------------------


Only special population gets tracked to prevent large amounts of memory being used for the program?


ways to track age?
-every x amount of game time, *this* many people die?

- each year the population spawned that year will be tracked, and after 100 years  (or however long) the people born
    in that year will die?


-similar system for bad people? Bad people per year -- this year, 10,000 people were born. a calculation will be run
    on that 10,000 to determine how many are evil

    -every game tick, the currently alive Murderers will have a "chance to murder" function run and will determine
        how many people they killed.



possible death calculation (per human class)? --   100*x^2 where x could be age




rating could be based from 0.0-1.0, closer to either end will be how good/bad you are


time rate could be variable? user decides how fast time moves?





game speed:

5 second in the real world =


spawn limit that doesn't seem forced!




there is an object for each year for every chunk that holds the value on that particular population and its values
    and once the population of that chunk dies the object is deleted.
















################################################################################################################
#################################################################################### CHUNKS


Possible 1 chunk per thread?

~~ 50 chunks?


Dummy chunk (for areas that won't have any lives -- ocean) so when you hover over it nothing shows and it doesn't take
    up and processing power



to set values for chunk effects-
    maybe a tier for chunks to prevent each chunk requiring its own values?
        -- like all 1st world chunks share the same values?


    maybe each chunk is always random and doesn't reflect the real world?

    --- a toggle for the user to decide?


    Do chunk tiers effect the tiers of those around it?
        - Not on release



    Each tier will have set effects




what kind of values numerically will the effects have? 1-10? higher?




will chunks just call a function to update population




each tier would have a small range within their values so that they calculations wouldn't all come out the same

i.e tier 1 > 1-3
    tier 2 > 4-7
    tier 3 > 8-10

           rather than updating every game update, these values are set at the beginning of the game






tier 1 (1st world)

- highest length of life
- lower chance of spawning bad people
- possibly higher chance of NDs to account for heightened population?
- lower birth rate


tier 2



tier 3 (3rd world)
-higher birth rate
-lower length of life
-higher chance of murderer
